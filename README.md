# eCommerce_Backend
Final Project for my current studies in CFGS DAM, about Multiplatform Software Development.
This program is able to read a database of products, for selecting an initial and end date for rental personal technological products, such as a camera or a tripod.
The program admits discounts that are shown in real time. Discounts by customer and discounts by more-than-one-day rental.
